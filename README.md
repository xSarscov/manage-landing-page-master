## Acknowledgments

I want to express my gratitude to [AlexCG Design](https://github.com/AlexCGDesign/). With the help of Alex's insightful tutorial on Tailwind CSS, I was able to embark on my journey with this powerful front-end framework. Their clear explanations and hands-on examples made it easier for me to grasp the concepts and start implementing them in my projects.
